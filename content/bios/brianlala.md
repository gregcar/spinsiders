Hey fellow Sharepointers/Powershellers/infrastru… ah never mind. My name is Brian Lalancette, and I’m a Premier Field Engineer (PFE) at Microsoft Canada.

This blog is a long time coming, and a realization of my New Year’s resolution for 2010 – to share some of the knowledge about SharePoint, server virtualization/infrastructure, and other tidbits I’ve picked up over my 18+ years in IT. Hope it can help some of you out, and always looking forward to hearing your thoughts & comments. All posts and info are provided without warranty, etc. etc. and I’m not responsible for blowing up your or my production servers, deleting all your data, or leaving coffee stains on your desk and crumbs in your keyboard.

Cheers!
Brian
