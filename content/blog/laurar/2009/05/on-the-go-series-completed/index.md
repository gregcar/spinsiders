Lori Gowin and I drove to Atlanta for SharePoint Saturday on April 18th.  We simply turned the camera on, and started talking.  For the past few weeks, I've been uploading one new file each night.  Now, the whole series has been uploaded for your viewing pleasure.

[Click here to see the list of all ELEVEN webcasts](http://spinsiders.com/laurar/webcasts/).  It will blow your mind (no, not really).

Before I had sliced our 2 big videos up into a bunch of little ~8 minute ones, I simply guessed that there would be about 10 of them.  There ended up being eleven.  Sorry, sue me.
