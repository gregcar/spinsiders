Good afternoon!

There is a new series of articles that I started writing, regarding the data view web part in SharePoint Designer.  These articles have been published on the endusersharepoint.com site, so I'll just link to them from here.

[Data View Web Part, The Basics - Insert a DVWP on Your Page](http://www.endusersharepoint.com/?p=1629) - This is a very simple set of instructions on how to insert a data view web part onto a web part page.  Future articles will go into more detail.
