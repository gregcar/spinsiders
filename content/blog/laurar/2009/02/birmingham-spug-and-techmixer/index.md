For my neighbors in Alabama, here's some information about SharePoint stuff going on in our neck of the woods:

### [Birmingham SharePoint User Group](https://ug.culminis.com/sites/BHamSPUG/BhamSPUG/default.aspx)

Meetings are the second Tuesday of every month, at the CTS office in Hoover.  On the website, you can "Join the Group", so that you'll receive email invites for each meeting.

### [Birmingham TechMixer Expo](http://www.techbirmingham.com/expo/)

February 19th, 2009. TechMixer Expo is a exposition event for the technology community of the greater Birmingham region.  Tech professionals and enthusiasts are invited to attend this FREE event which is centered on the numerous Technology User Groups and Technology Supporting Companies in the region.  This is the 5th edition of TechMixer Expo.  The last Expo attracted over 800 attendees and 70+ sponsors.

The event is hosted on the entire 3rd floor of the McWane Science Center.  Parking in the deck is free (deck entrance on 2nd Ave N) at which you can access the event entrance from Level C.  Valet parking on the curb of 2nd Ave North will also be available.  Free finger foods and a cash bar.

### I'll be working the B'ham SPUG booth this Thursday (Feb 19th, 2009) at TechMixer.  Hope to see you there!
