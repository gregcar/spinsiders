Looking forward to speaking at the SharePoint Best Practices Conference this week in San Diego!

[Brett Lonsdale](http://www.brettlonsdale.com) ([Lightning Tools](http://www.lightningtools.com/)) and I will be doing a presentation called [Making the Most of the Out-of-the-Box Web Parts](http://www.sharepointbestpractices.com/agenda#IW339).  In this presentation, we will go over all of the web parts that come with MOSS.  Brett is the BDC guru, so he'll be covering all of the BDC web parts, and also data view web parts.  It's a lot to cover.  We'll see how well we cram all of this information into a one hour session.
