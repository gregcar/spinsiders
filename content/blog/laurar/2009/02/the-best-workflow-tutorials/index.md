Just thought I'd let everyone know where I learned everything I know about workflows.  This site is friggin awesome, and the tutorials are very detailed.  You can tell that this guy, Stephen, put a lot of work into this.

Then, just recently, by popular demand, he posted all of the associated files that he used in his demo!!

It might take half a day, but I recommend that you go through all of his tutorials when you get a chance.
