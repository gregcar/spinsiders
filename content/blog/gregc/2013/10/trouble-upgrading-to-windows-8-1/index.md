I know I sure had a lot of trouble upgrading! I did all the updates like I was supposed to and the download would just not show up in the store! Very frustrating experience. So I did was all good IT folks to - Googled it!

The end procedure was simple actually:

- Crack open IE on your target upgrade box
- Paste the following link in your address bar and hit enter

`ms-windows-store:WindowsUpgrade?ocid=GA8-1_O_WOL_Hero_Buy_81Update_Null_01`

- This should open the Windows Store to a nice Windows 8.1 download
- Click download and wait for it to start prompting you for action

This procedure seems to work for both Windows RT and Windows Pro. Special thank you to [francescob](http://www.neowin.net/forum/user/267310-francescob/) who was kind enough to post the above Windows Store link in the comments section of [this](http://www.neowin.net/news/windows-81-available-to-download-now) article.
