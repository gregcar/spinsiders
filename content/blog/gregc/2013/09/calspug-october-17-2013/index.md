I am very excited to tell you that [Ruven Gotz](https://twitter.com/ruveng) (yes his [blog](http://spinsiders.com/ruveng/) is also part of [spinsiders.com](http://spinsiders.com/)) will be presenting the topic "[Taxonomies, Content Types and Metadata, Oh My!](http://calspug-2013-10-17.eventbrite.ca/)" this October at our regular CalSPUG meeting day on the third Thursday of the month (Oct. 17th). Doors open at 5:00, presentation should start around 5:30 with food and drinks provided! To register, please do so here:Â [http://calspug-2013-10-17.eventbrite.ca/](http://calspug-2013-10-17.eventbrite.ca/).

For those keen individuals, you may have also noticed that we haven't announced anything for September yet. While it doesn't look likely that we will be having an event this month (due to scheduling conflicts), we are working diligently with presenter to organize a possible second event in October. Please keep an eye to your inbox for further details.
