I have  been asked about this topic a few times in recent weeks and really wanted to keep this diagram handy, so I thought what better place to put it than my blog!  Microsoft has provided a lovely info document on this exact topic which can be found [here](http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/9/6/49646604-D168-4F42-9011-481BA048BEC3/multi-farm-sharepoint-2013.pdf).

Looks pretty useful as far as I can tell. Enjoy! :)
