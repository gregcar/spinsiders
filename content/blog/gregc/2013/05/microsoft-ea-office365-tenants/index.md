title: "Microsoft EA & Office 365 Tenants"

Important little thing to know when dealing with larger companies in particular: Microsoft only allows one Office 365 tenant per Enterprise Agreement.

While a company can have many Office 365 tenants, all the additional ones cannot be part of the company's existing EA with Microsoft. I will try to get some links to official documentation on this policy.
