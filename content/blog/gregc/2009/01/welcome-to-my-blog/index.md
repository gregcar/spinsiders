Hi everyone and welcome to my blog! This is actually my very first blog post ever – on any topic!

Just a little bit about me: I am a SharePoint consultant (Business Analyst by title) with [Ideaca Knowledge Services](http://www.ideaca.com) based in Toronto, Canada. I have been actively working with SharePoint for three years now and have been specializing more in the developmental and architectural aspects of SharePoint. In a previous life I worked both with SAP and Microsoft Exchange. In my spare time (yes – I have figured out how to have a life outside of SharePoint – only took 3 years!!) I read, have started to get myself back into decent shape, and intend to spend a significant amount of time outside this summer.

In this blog I intend to cover various aspects of SharePoint with more of a focus towards development. I also plan to post solutions to questions I am asked over the course of my projects (and outside of them), so feel free to email me (gregc at spinsiders dot com) and I’ll do my best to respond. I have a very ambitious goal of posting something at least once a week, so check back often!

If you are less interested in the technical aspects of SharePoint and more interested in the methods that could be employed to gather the requirements for a SharePoint implementation, take a look at my friend & colleague Ruven Gotz’ blog at [http://spinsiders.com/ruveng](http://spinsiders.com/ruveng). He has some excellent articles on answering the SharePoint chicken & egg question and how to run the workshops to get to that answer.
