Once again - a long time since I have posted.  Perhaps I should just end trying to post at a pre-defined frequency and aim for something a bit more natural?

At lot has changed for me of the last several months, especially since starting this blog.  One of those things in particular was my decision to move to [Calgary, Alberta, Canada](http://maps.google.ca/maps?q=calgary,+ab,+ca&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Calgary,+Division+No.+6,+Alberta&gl=ca&ei=4srCS-XTK4vgngeayr2rCg&ved=0CAgQ8gEwAA&z=10 "Calgary, AB, Canada").  I was previously living in Toronto, Ontario, Canada - and had been for 4 years - but decided it was time to try out a new city.  So,  I transferred with [Ideaca](http://www.ideaca.com "Ideaca Knowledge Services Ltd.") and have taken up residence in the heart of Calgary.

With some of the time I have saved commuting around the Toronto area, I have joined [CalSPUG](http://www.calspug.org "CalSPUG - Home") (Calgary SharePoint User Group - [www.calspug.org](http://www.calspug.org "CalSPUG Home")).  I must admit, it's very rewarding becoming more involved with the SharePoint community as a whole - but especially on the eve of the release of [SharePoint 2010](http://http://sharepoint2010.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft SharePoint 2010").  As such, I would like to highlight, for those in the Calgary area, that we're having our next meeting on [April 22, 2010](http://www.calspug.com/Lists/Events%20Calendar/DispForm.aspx?ID=5 "CalSPUG - April 22, 2010 - Meeting").  [Jason Kaczor](http://jasonkaczor.spaces.live.com/ "Jason Kaczor's Space") is our presenter and the topic is [Use SharePoint 2010 and Visual Studio 2010 to boost Productivity](http://www.calspug.com/Lists/Events%20Calendar/DispForm.aspx?ID=5 "CalSPUG - Use SharePoint 2010 and Visual Studio 2010 to boost Productivity").  The meeting will begin sharply at 5:30 PM MDT with a SharePint to follow at the [James Joyce](http://www.jamesjoycepub.com/ "James Joyce Irish Pub") ([map](http://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&ie=UTF8&q=james+joyce+calgary&fb=1&gl=ca&hq=james+joyce&hnear=calgary&cid=0,0,817631841490709561&ei=2MzCS-LxD4O0lQeKrYHdBA&ved=0CAoQnwIwAA&z=16&iwloc=A "James Joyce Irish Pub - Location")) at approximately 8:30 PM MDT.  Anyone is welcome.  It's completely free of charge and pizza and beverages are provided.  Registration is available [here](http://www.calspug.com/Lists/Registration/NewForm.aspx?RootFolder=%2FLists%2FRegistration&Source=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ecalspug%2Ecom%2F&EventId=5 "CalSPUG - April 22, 2010 - Registration").

For those of you whom are unable to attend Thursday evening's presentation.  Jason will also be presenting this topic on [April 19, 2010](http://www.devteach.com/wconnect/wc.dll?FournierTransformation~1,26,1,19 "MS DevTech Registration") at 8:30 AM MDT (breakfast provided) as part of Microsoft's [DevTech Breakfast and User Group tour](http://www.devteach.com/Community/Index.aspx "MS DevTech Breakfast and User Group Tour").

Happy SharePointing!
