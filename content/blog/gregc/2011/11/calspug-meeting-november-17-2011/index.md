Another month means another [CalSPUG](http://www.calspug.org "CalSPUG") meeting! (Web site should be up soon... sorry for the dead link.)

This meeting should be a good one - and a non-developer topic as well. However... most developers should be interested in this!

**Title** Keep Your Portal Governance Simple!

**Start Time** Doors open at 5:00pm. Presentation starts at 5:30pm. \*Note: Elevators up will lock at 6:00pm if you arrive late.

**Presenter** Dan McCleary ([@DanMcCleary](https://twitter.com/#!/DanMcCleary))

**Topic** Many people seem to dread the word governance. Dread of the amount of work involved. Dread of not knowing how to proceed. Dread of unnecessary bureaucracy. Unfortunately, this hesitance is what kills a lot of good portal governance planning. Yet, if some basic elements are put in place, a model can be built that can be understood by all portal users and is relatively easy to maintain.

**Speaker Bio** Dan McCleary has worked in the internet industry for over 15 years holding many positions including designer, developer, project manager and instructor. Between 2006 and 2010 Dan held the position of Consulting Director at [Ideaca](http://www.ideaca.com), one of Canada's leading IT and Management Consulting companies, in charge of the consulting staff for their largest office. He has recently ventured back into the consulting world, focusing his efforts on portals, collaboration and social media. A goal of his management consulting approach is to provide clarity by striving for simplicity.

Food and drinks provided. SharePint location TBD.
