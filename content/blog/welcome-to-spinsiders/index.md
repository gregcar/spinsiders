This blog site was started in September 2008 by [Ruven Gotz](http://spinsiders.com/ruveng "Ruven's blog") and [Greg Carnie](http://spinsiders.com/gregc), two members of the Portals and Collaboration team at [Ideaca](http://www.ideaca.com "Ideaca's web site")**\*** in Toronto.  Greg has since transferred from Ideaca's Toronto office and taken up residence at their Calgary office, and Ruven now works at [Navantis](http://www.navantis.com "Navantis").

We are two very different kind of SharePoint experts: Greg is into the full spectrum of SharePoint Architecture/Development/Deployment. Ruven is interested more in the Business Analysis and Information Architecture side of the process. That being said, we do overlap, and learn about each other's areas, so that we can talk intelligently with each other and with our clients.

In January 2008, we added a new person to the roster: [Laura Rogers](http://spinsiders.com/laurar "Laura's blog") who was (at the time) a SharePoint Administrator at HealthSouth Corporation**\*** in Birmingham, Alabama and the author of a chapter in the [Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 Administrator's Companion](http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft®-Office-SharePoint®-Administrators-Companion/dp/0735622825 "Amazon link to this book").  In September 2009, Laura officially left us as she decided to join [SharePoint911](http://www.sharepoint911.com/ "SharePoint 911")**\*** and thus it made sense for her to move [her blog](http://www.sharepoint911.com/blogs/laura "Laura Rogers") to their system.

In February 2010, [Brian Lalancette](http://spinsiders.com/brianlala/ "Lala Land") became the fourth official contributor to spinsiders.com with his perspective on the infrastructure side of SharePoint, but in particular how PowerShell can be leveraged with regards to SharePoint.  Brian is also a member of the Portals & Collaboration team at [Navantis](http://www.navantis.com "Navantis")**\*** in Toronto.
