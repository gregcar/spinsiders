People who have seen me speak, or read my blog before know how much emphasis I place on visual tools for reaching shared understanding. The evolution of my practice with visual tools, from mind mapping to Dialogue Mapping was prompted by Paul Culmsee.

Paul is a great writer and a brilliant thinker who has forever changed the way that I see the world of exploring difficult (wicked!) problems in environments that have a lot social complexity (i.e. almost all of them!).

If you want to get a feel for the type of thinking and work that Paul does, you'll really want to watch these two videos.

[In the first one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=ymyYuseFpzg "Paul's history and approach with Dialogue Mapping (youtube)"), you will hear Paul talk about his thinking and approach, and [in the second one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-sv5I59Fxw&feature=player_embedded "A live demo of Dialogue Mapping by Paul"), you will see a live demonstration of Dialogue Mapping by one of the world leaders in this technique.

Let me know what you think. Is this something that could change the way you work, like it has for me?
