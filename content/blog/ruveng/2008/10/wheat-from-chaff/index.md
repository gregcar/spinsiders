When you search the net for SharePoint answers, how do you know if what you find is a good answer or not? Sometimes a post that’s been around a long time comes back much earlier in the results, even if newer and better approaches have been documented or discovered.

Into the fray jumps [StackOverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com "StackOverflow.com") where people can vote answers up or down. This site is targeted mostly at developers, but even though it only launched recently it already has [over 200 SharePoint questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged?tagnames=sharepoint "SharePoint questions on StackOverflow.com") many of which are not directly about programming.

Some of the nice features are how the site is very reputation driven: People who have built up more reputation have the power to do more things, like edit questions or answers; answers that become outdated can be voted down, allowing better answers to float to the top over time.
