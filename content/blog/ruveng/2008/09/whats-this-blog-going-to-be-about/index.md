Welcome to my first post.

My main goal for this blog is to cover issues related to Information Architecture (IA) for SharePoint. However, this blog will also cover many other aspects of SharePoint.

As a consultant who leads SharePoint projects from early planning through deployment, I deal with questions and decisions at many different levels. Although my key expertise is in the design/planning/IA area, I feel that it is important for me to have a strong technical understanding of how SharePoint works.  I am not an infrastructure expert, a designer or a developer, but I try to understand these areas as deeply as I can to be able to understand the range of solution possibilities and to make sure that I understand the approaches that my implementation team is taking. (Note: if you really want to get really technical, read my friend and co-worker's blog: [spinsiders.com/greg](http://www.spinsiders.com/greg "www.spinsiders.com/greg").)

So, you can expect to see a variety of topics covered here. Some may be more technical, and some may be less. I hope that with feedback from readers, I'll be able to find a good mix of information that will make this site worth your time.
