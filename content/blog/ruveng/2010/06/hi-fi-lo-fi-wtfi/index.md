Erik Swenson has published a post showing his [phenomenal collection of wireframes](http://erikswenson.blogspot.com/2010/06/sharepoint-2010-ia-wireframe-toolkit.html "Erik Swenson's Blog") for SharePoint 2010. I remember when he showed me his SharePoint 2007 wireframes in Montreal last year and being blown away.

Erik's approach is to go super Hi-Fi. By that I mean that he creates exact, faithful reproductions of the SharePoint interface in Visio. But, since Erik is not allowed to share these widely, you may want to consider another approach: Instead of creating Hi-Fi wireframes (and investing the incredible amount of work required), try the Lo-Fi approach.

I prefer this course of action, because, depending on the phase of the project, I don't want clients to think too much about how it will 'actually look', but more about 'what function/element belongs where'.

The tool I use is super fast and easy (and cheap), and you can even use it interactively during client workshops. It is called [Balsamiq Mockups](http://balsamiq.com/ "Balsamiq Mockups") (www.balsamiq.com).

And, just when you think this can't possibly get any easier, along comes Gordon MacLeod (a fellow Torontonian) who has created a bunch of pre-built SharePoint elements that you can download for free from here: [http://mockupstogo.net/prebuilt-sharepoint-elements](http://mockupstogo.net/prebuilt-sharepoint-elements "Mockups To Go - SharePoint").

I have heard great arguments for both the Lo-Fi and Hi-Fi approaches, and they both have their uses. For me, fast, schematic and interactive wins out.

Happy wireframing,

Ruven
