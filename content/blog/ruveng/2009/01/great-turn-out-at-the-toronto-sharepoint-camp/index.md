These types of events have often been very technically focused, so I wasn't sure how many people would turn out for my sessions on **_"Mind Mapping Tools for the Information Architect"_** and **_"Effective Requirements Gathering Workshops – How to organize and run them"_**. I was pleasantly surprised when my room filled up nicely (between 40 - 60 people at each session), with quite a few staying for both.

I attended some really interesting sessions as well:   - MOSS Search: Why it’s not enough to just turn it on by Nadeem Mitha   - Effective Deployment of SharePoint Publishing Sites by Ivan Neganov   - Architecture into Implementation: The practical limits of people and SharePoint by Eli Robillard

For those who are looking to **download my presentations**, they are at the following link:

The items that begin with "Ruven Gotz" are the actual presentations. The rest are PDF's of Mind Maps that I used as examples.

Congratulations to Eli Robillard and Bill Brockbank (and a ton of other volunteers) for putting together a great event. There were well over 200 attendees and I heard a lot of positive comments from a number of "Happy Campers".
