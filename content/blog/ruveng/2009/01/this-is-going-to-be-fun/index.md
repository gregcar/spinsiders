There's a new blog in town and if I tell you it's called [The SharePoint Mad Scientist](http://www.sharepointmadscientist.com), then I've told you just about all you need to know. If I tell you that it's written by Mike Watson, that'll fill in the rest of the picture.

If you want to check it out, read [this post](http://www.sharepointmadscientist.com/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=6) first. You'll learn that Mike comes from years at Microsoft, but is now with [Quest](http://www.quest.com/sharepoint/) and that his mind doesn't necessarily work the same as yours and mine, but that's what makes his stuff interesting. I'm looking forward to his impact on the SharePoint world, both from his work at Quest from the book he's working on with [Joel Oleson](http://www.sharepointjoel.com/default.aspx).
