You want to attend one of the big conferences this year, don't you? You want to hear SharePoint experts speak so that you can get great new ideas and you like bumping into fellow SharePointers for networking and fun.

**But...**

Justifying $500 - 1,000 for airfare, $300 - 600 for food and hotel and more than $1,000 for the registration fee just won't fit your departments (or your personal) budget?

**Well...**

If you live in the Greater Toronto Area, you have a fantastic option coming up very soon. **On July 11th, there is going to be a FREE conference in Toronto**. This is put on by the community (i.e. unpaid SharePoint experts). Microsoft is lending us their meeting rooms at their head office in Mississauga.

**And...**

If you think that you'll be getting any less of an experience than you would at a 'big' conference take a look at who's talking:

**Bill Brockbank**  - MVP **Reza Alirezaei** \- MVP, Author, International Conference Speaker **Rob Windsor** - MVP, International Conference Speaker

The co-author of _Professional Microsoft® SharePoint® 2007 Design by Wrox Publishing_, **Coskun Cavusoglu** will be there and others that I've seen speak before include **Kanwal Khipple**, and **Shai Petel**.

And, of course, me! You can see me here for free, or you can pay to see me speak at the Best Practices conference in Washington in August. I'll be presenting my talk on _MindMapping for the Information Architect_, which was rated 3rd out of 75 sessions by attendees at the February Best Practices conference in San Diego.

See the [complete list of speakers](http://www.sharepointsaturday.org/toronto/Pages/speakers.aspx "Speakers List") on the site.

**So...**

Hear some of the best in the business; get all the knowledge and networking that you need and want; get a free lunch (yes, it does exist); and, like the guy on the ING Direct ad says: "Save your money".

I hope I'll see you there!
