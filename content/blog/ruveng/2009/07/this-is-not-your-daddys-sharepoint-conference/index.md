![Ensuring SharePoint Success - Mentoring Workshop](images/sharepointsuccessworkshop.jpg)

I love going to conferences. I get clues for new approaches, tips to save time or try a new feature and, sometimes, a bit of deeper insight that turns me into a better consultant and helps me to make my clients even happier.

But...

If I am still below the â€˜knee' of the learning curve on a topic, a conference just doesn't give me enough to go on. I could sign-up for a training course, but that means trying to find a course that matches my exact needs (they never do). Given the lead-time for developing a course, these can sometimes be out-of-date or pitching to the lowest common denominator. Often, they are more focussed on technology rather than solutions.

To the Rescue...

We ([Dux Sy, Paul Culmsee, Andrew Woodward and I](http://www.innovative-e.com/pages/mentors.aspx)) are doing something different. So different in fact, that we had a hard time figuring out what to call it.

It is part:

- Conference
- Mentoring
- Coaching
- Workshop
- Consulting
- Training

And it is entirely focussed on delivering successful SharePoint solutions from the point of view of the:

- CIO
- Project Champion
- Project Manager
- Project Lead
- Information Architec
- Decision Maker
- Program Manager
- Business Analyst

In three days of intense workshops and discussion sessions (including optional dinner discussions), we will talk about what has worked in multiple SharePoint installations that we have worked on. Note that we will not be giving you the "formula" for success, as every project is different. Rather, we'll be giving you the tools that will let you create your own success formula.

It's in the Washington D.C. area from August 19 - 21. It will cost you less than a thousand bucks to register, there will be less than 30 people there and it will be intense: You will get real news-that-you-can-use value out of it.

You can read the details here: [http://www.innovative-e.com/pages/workshopspa.aspx](http://www.innovative-e.com/pages/workshopspa.aspx)

I hope we see you there!
