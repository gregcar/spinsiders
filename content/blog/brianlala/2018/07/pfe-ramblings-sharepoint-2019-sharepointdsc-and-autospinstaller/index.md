With the [recent announcement and release of the Public Preview of SharePoint Server 2019](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-SharePoint-Blog/Announcing-Availability-of-SharePoint-Server-2019-Preview/ba-p/214427), my fellow PFE [Nik Charlebois](https://twitter.com/NikCharlebois) and I thought we'd record a quick chat of our thoughts on the state of things around SharePoint and two of the most popular automated installation approaches, [SharePointDSC](https://github.com/PowerShell/SharePointDSC) and [AutoSPInstaller](https://autospinstaller.com).

Head on over to [Nik's blog](https://nikcharlebois.com/pfe-ramblings-future-of-autospinstaller-and-sharepointdsc/) for the full run-down, and a recording of our chat as well.

Cheers
