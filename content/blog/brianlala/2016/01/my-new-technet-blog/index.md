Just a quick update to let you know that, as of January 26, 2016, any non-personal technical posts will go to [https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/brianlala/](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/brianlala/) instead of here. It just makes sense (and in fact is a bit late) since I've been working at Microsoft since August 2015.

Keep checking back here just in case though - I might still decide to post the odd personal rant here :)

Cheers Brian
