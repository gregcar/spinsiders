Yes, I've left the default title up there - because this is indeed my "hello" from within the walls of Microsoft. I started working for Microsoft back in August 2015 and it's been a head-spinning, firehose-drinking exercise ever since. Looking forward to sharing some good thoughts and info on my new blog in the coming weeks, months & years!

Cheers Brian
