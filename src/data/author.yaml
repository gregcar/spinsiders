  bio: "I am a SharePoint consultant (Business Analyst by title) with Ideaca Knowledge Services based in Toronto, Canada.  I have been actively working with SharePoint for three years now and have been specializing more in the developmental and architectural aspects of SharePoint.  In a previous life I worked both with SAP and Microsoft Exchange.  In my spare time (yes – I have figured out how to have a life outside of SharePoint – only took 3 years!!) I read, have started to get myself back into decent shape, and intend to spend a significant amount of time outside this summer."

This blog is a long time coming, and a realization of my New Year’s resolution for 2010 – to share some of the knowledge about SharePoint, server virtualization/infrastructure, and other tidbits I’ve picked up over my 18+ years in IT. Hope it can help some of you out, and always looking forward to hearing your thoughts & comments. All posts and info are provided without warranty, etc. etc. and I’m not responsible for blowing up your or my production servers, deleting all your data, or leaving coffee stains on your desk and crumbs in your keyboard.
